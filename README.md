# Warehouse_Management

This is a Java-based application simulating a warehouse management system that handles clients, products, and orders. The system allows users to add, edit, search, and delete clients/products and create and view orders. It generates invoices for each order and stores all data in a MySQL database using a contractor-like pattern for efficient data access. The application features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Java Swing, providing a user-friendly experience for managing operations.

Key features include:

    Order processing: Users can create orders by selecting clients and products.
    Client/product management: CRUD functionality for clients and products.
    Invoice generation: Automatically creates invoices in a "bill.txt" file.
    Database interaction: Data is stored and managed in a MySQL relational database with dynamic object handling using Java Reflection.
